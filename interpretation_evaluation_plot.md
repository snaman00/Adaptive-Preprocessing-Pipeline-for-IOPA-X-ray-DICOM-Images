#Interpretation of the Evaluation Plots

## **1. PSNR Comparison (Top-Left Plot)**
- **Observation:** The orange bars (Adaptive) consistently show the highest PSNR across all image indices.
- **Conclusion:** The adaptive pipeline produces cleaner reconstructions (less noise), which correlates with higher image fidelity.
- **Adaptive is clearly superior in PSNR.**

## **2. SSIM Comparison (Top-Right Plot)**
- **Observation:** Surprisingly, Original images (green) have the highest SSIM, with Adaptive and Static trailing behind.
- **Interpretation:** The preprocessing steps (both static and adaptive) may slightly alter the pixel structure, causing SSIM to drop. However, SSIM penalizes even helpful structural changes, so a lower SSIM doesn't necessarily imply worse visual or clinical quality.
- **Original is better in SSIM, but Adaptive outperforms Static in 4 out of 7 images.**

## **3. Sharpness (Laplacian Variance) (Bottom-Left Plot)**
- **Observation:** The Static approach (blue) consistently shows higher sharpness values, especially for image indices 0, 4, 5, and 6.
- **Conclusion:** Static enhancement applies aggressive sharpening, which may introduce artifacts or noise. In contrast, the Adaptive method offers more controlled sharpening â€” enhancing image detail without over-processing.
- **Static is better on raw sharpness, but Adaptive may yield better diagnostic clarity.**

## **4. Edge Clarity (Canny Edge Detection) (Bottom-Right Plot)**
- **Observation:** Static preprocessing results in the highest edge pixel counts across all image indices. Adaptive preprocessing produces fewer edges than Static, but generally more than Original.
- **Conclusion:** High edge counts from Static may indicate contrast boosts but can also introduce false edges. Adaptive strikes a balance by highlighting clinically relevant edges while suppressing noise.
- **High edge count does not mean high image quality. Adaptive may be more clinically meaningful.**

## **Overall Perfromance of Adaptive Pipeline**
The Adaptive pipeline model appears better than the static approach based on :
- PNSR dominance.
- Moderate and appropriate sharpening.
- Balanced edge clearity.
- No over-processing risk.

Here the slightly lower SSIM could be tolerated given the significant PSNR gains, especially since medical clarity (not pixel-perfect structure) is the goal in enhancement pipelines.
