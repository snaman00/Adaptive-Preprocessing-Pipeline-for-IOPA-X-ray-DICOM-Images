# Adaptive-Preprocessing-Pipeline-for-IOPA-X-ray-DICOM-Images
## Introduction
Digital dental radiographs, especially IOPA X-rays, are pivotal in identifying lesions, infections, and bone structure anomalies. However, raw DICOM images often suffer from artifacts like noise, low contrast, or varying sharpness due to inconsistent acquisition protocols.This project addresses this problem by developing an adaptive preprocessing pipeline that analyzes image quality parameters and intelligently enhances them. The pipeline ensures all input images are standardized and optimized for further analysis using AI models, improving accuracy and reliability.
